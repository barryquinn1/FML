\title{Expected Maximum Sharpe Ratio}
\usage{
getExpectedMaxSR(nTrails, meanSR = 0, stdSR = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{nTrails}{double the number of trails (note that 1 trail will produce a -Inf results)}

\item{meanSR}{mean of the Sharpe ratio of the null false strategy}

\item{stdSR}{standard deviation of the Sharpe ratio of the null false strategy}
}
\value{
numeric
}
\description{
Calculate the theoretical Maximum Sharpe Ratio according
to the False Discovery theorem first proposed
by Bailey et al. 2014. Its returns values of
the expected maximum Sharpe ratio controlling for the
selection bias under multiple testing (SBuMT).

\examples{
